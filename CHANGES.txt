Tweaked up the comments, removed AUTHOR and vcs $blah cruft from all code.
Fixed dumb output error in "data" used for interpolation into HTML output.
Separated web server into separate module, moved tester into separate dir.

Issue 1 at the google tracker requests to have the server available on a
different interface. I added a parameter to the LoggingServerWebService to
allow specification of a different interface though I haven't figured out how
to get twistd to pass a command line parameter in yet...that's funny, seems
like I was involved in a discussion on the twisted mailing list about this a
while ago; you can't.  The suggestion was to "write a plug-in."  Wonderful.

Removed hard-coded limit on number of records kept by LoggingServerModel to be
configurable on instantiation rather than fixed at 200. Changed default to 30
to accommodate my needs; 200 just took too long to refresh in the browser.
Since it's configurable now, the default could be put back to 200 if it
bothers anyone.

I changed this since I have different destinations for these queues that
require different amounts of back-storage.

I'll probably make a couple of variants since one of my use-cases is to whizz
the logging info out a WebSocket where I want the queue to empty as quickly as
the data is able to be sent out so I don't have to keep a bucket of them
around.

I'm keeping a verbose changelog in each file in case Doug wants to pull my
stuff over without having to go nuts trying to figure out what exactly I
changed.

Created new repository at https://github.com/ssteinerx/python-loggingserver

Fixed loggingprotocol.py's initialization of the logging system. It had been
done in the __init__ of the LoggingProtocol which caused logging to stop as
soon as a second incoming logger started. This fixed 2 bugs as noted in the
tracker (2 & 3).
